In this application there are three mode to find out match between input-string and pattern.

First mode fairly easy: it finds full match.
Second mode find at least partial match.

And third mode include following features:
1) Each side (input-string and pattern) must has equal count of words.
2) There is 3 variety of matches: 
  a) If pattern includes 1 and more repeating excessive symbol
  b) One symbol can be absent in word, but if count of symbols exceeds value = 10 then count of allowable symbols increase on 1. This operation is cyclical.
  b) 1 and more symbols can be not match in word. Regularity of increase allowoble count of symbols based on rule written one point before.
3) Maximum count of matches between words per sentence =~ 37% computed from count of senten's words.
